# Lean JS App Starter Webpack Parts

[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/ljas-webpack.svg?colorB=brightgreen)](https://npmjs.com/package/ljas-webpack) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](https://github.com/mattlean/ljas-webpack/blob/master/LICENSE)

These are the configuration parts used for the [webpack](https://webpack.js.org) config compositions for [Lean JavaScript Application Starter](https://github.com/mattlean/lean-js-app-starter).

## Install

`npm install --save-dev ljas-webpack`

`yarn add --dev ljas-webpack`

## Usage

To compose custom webpack configs with these parts, you should use them with [webpack-merge](https://npmjs.com/package/webpack-merge). The expected composition strategy is described on the ["Composing Configuration" page](https://survivejs.com/webpack/developing/composing-configuration) in the SurviveJS webpack book—a book written by an ex-webpack core team member, Juho Vepsäläinen.
