# Lean JS App Starter Webpack Parts
These are the configuration parts used for the webpack config compositions for [Lean JavaScript Application Starter](https://github.com/mattlean/lean-js-app-starter).

To use this package properly for your custom configs, you should use [webpack-merge](https://npmjs.com/package/webpack-merge). The expected composition strategy is described on the ["Composing Configuration" page](https://survivejs.com/webpack/developing/composing-configuration) in the SurviveJS webpack book—a book written by an ex-webpack core team member, Juho Vepsäläinen.
